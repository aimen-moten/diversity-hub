# Diversity Hub

Diversity Hub was built for students, by students. As a Computer Science major at a small liberal arts college, I have observed a lack of resources and mentorship at my university. Thus, I collaborated with a peer to create this web application that provides resources for students in the tech industry.

Students can:
*Find mentors through our carefully created job board.
*Find internship and job postings.
*Find communities and clubs they can join on-campus and off-campus.
*Sign up for our newsletter to remain up to date with tech and tech job market trends.

Front-end built using:
*React.js
*TailwindCSS
*CSS

Back-end (currently in progress) built using:
*Node.js
*JWT Authentication
